/**
 * Parameters that can be used for tweaking how the tests behave.
 *
 * @param stackSafeIterationsCount specifies the number of iterations
 *        necessary in loops meant to prove stack safety; needed
 *        because these tests can be very heavy
 *
 * @param allowNonTerminationLaws specifies if the laws that detect
 *        non-termination (e.g. `IO.never`) should be enabled or not.
 *        Default is `true`, however if the only way to detect non-termination
 *        is to block the thread with a timeout, then that makes tests
 *        really hard to evaluate, so it's best if they are disabled
