/**
 * @define mVarDescription A mutable location, that is either empty or contains a value of type `A`.
 *
 * It has the following fundamental atomic operations:
 *
 *  - [[put]] which fills the var if empty, or blocks
 *    (asynchronously) until the var is empty again
 *  - [[tryPut]] which fills the var if empty. returns true if successful
 *  - [[take]] which empties the var if full, returning the contained
 *    value, or blocks (asynchronously) otherwise until there is
 *    a value to pull
 *  - [[tryTake]] empties if full, returns None if empty.
 *  - [[read]] which reads the current value without touching it,
 *    assuming there is one, or otherwise it waits until a value
 *    is made available via `put`
 *  - `tryRead` returns a variable if it exists. Implemented in the successor [[MVar2]]
 *  - `swap` takes a value, replaces it and returns the taken value. Implemented in the successor [[MVar2]]
 *  - [[isEmpty]] returns true if currently empty
 *
 * The `MVar` is appropriate for building synchronization
 * primitives and performing simple inter-thread communications.
 * If it helps, it's similar with a `BlockingQueue(capacity = 1)`,
 * except that it doesn't block any threads, all waiting being
 * done asynchronously (via [[Async]] or [[Concurrent]] data types,
 * such as [[IO]]).
 *
 * Given its asynchronous, non-blocking nature, it can be used on
 * top of Javascript as well.
 *
 * Inspired by `Control.Concurrent.MVar` from Haskell and
 * by `scalaz.concurrent.MVar`.
